Welcome to the new home of SCP Viz - A universal vizualization platform for single protein analysis in single cell proteomics data

Just want to get running with SCP Viz? Here is a tutorial video. https://youtu.be/eK5RtNQMviY

Single Cell Proteomics by mass spectrometry is an exciting and emerging field of research that has yet to take a final form. You can use many mass spectrometers and you can use any of the over 1,000 LCMS data analysis platforms to process your data. The one constant right now is that when you've got hundreds of cells it is very difficult to see what each single protein is doing. And this is where SCP Viz comes in.

SCP Viz is simple and lightweight and it just plots your target single molecule of interest across as many cells as you want. 
Proteomics data? Sure. Peptide level proteomics data? That as well. Post-translational modifications? Absolutely? 
Once this was flexible enough to work for most major LCMS based proteomics datasets, it was flexible for just about anything else. In the upcoming paper we'll show how single cell transcriptomics and proteomics of the same cells treated with the same drug can all be evaluated here to understand how a small molecule inhibitor is working.
